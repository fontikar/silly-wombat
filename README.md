Abstract: 

Data science is an ever-evolving industry that requires constant upskilling. 
The pressures to learn the latest tools for project deliverables or to enhance oneâ€™s CV can be a hindrance to effective learning. 
Here, I argue for the need for silliness when developing new R skills.
Learning is far more enjoyable and conducive to retention and application when we take away the seriousness of upskilling.
I will share my experience in creating ohwhaley - a toy R package which serves as a tool for learning package development and upskilling new learners.
I hope attendees will walk away feeling more light-hearted and empowered to build silly things in R to reinvigorate their curiosity for R knowledge.
